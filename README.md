# Market Sentiment vs Trader Behavior

This project analyzes how market sentiment (Fear, Greed, Neutral) influences trader behavior using real-world datasets. It was created as part of a Data Science internship assignment for Primetrade.ai.

The analysis explores patterns in trading volume, profitability (PnL), and buy/sell behavior by aligning historical trade data with the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index.


## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- ðŸ“ˆ **Volume:** Traders were most active during **Fear**, followed by **Greed**
- ðŸ’° **Profitability:** Average PnL per trade was **highest in Fear** and lowest in Greed
- ðŸ”„ **Trade Direction:**  
  - **More BUYs** occurred during Fear (dip-buying behavior)  
  - **More SELLs** occurred during Greed (profit-taking behavior)

These findings suggest that traders behave more cautiously and profitably during fearful market conditions.
